   <p>Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations. Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.</p>
